/*
Note :
One of the main advantages of using this approach is when you want to process 100 requests at a time, but do not want to create 100 Threads for the same, so as to reduce JVM overload. You can use this approach to create a ThreadPool of 10 Threads and you can submit 100 requests to this ThreadPool.
ThreadPool will create maximum of 10 threads to process 10 requests at a time.  After process completion of any single Thread,
ThreadPool will internally allocate the 11th request to this Thread
and will keep on doing the same to all the remaining requests.
